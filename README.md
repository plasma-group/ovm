# Optimistic Virtual Machine
This repository contains standards and reference resources for those who wish to build or learn about the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM).

## What's the OVM?
The OVM is a virtual machine designed to support all layer 2 (L2) protocols. Its generality comes from a reframing of L2 as an “optimistic” fork choice rule layered on top of Ethereum. The formalization borrows heavily from CBC Casper research, and describes layer 2 as a direct extension to layer 1 consensus. This implies a possible unification of all “layer 2 scalability” constructions (Lightning, Plasma, etc) under a single theory and virtual machine: the OVM.

There are two major components:

1. Universal Adjudication Contracts--Ethereum smart contracts which are capable of adjudicating any multi-party dispute.
2. OVM engine--Local OVM engine which optimistically evaluates these on-chain disputes & locally determines the result, enabling L2 scalability.

### Ask questions?
The place to ask questions about the OVM is:

[**https://plasma.build/**](https://plasma.build/)

You'll find a group of folks that are objectively super duper cool and that, more likely than not, would love to answer your questions :)

### Implement the OVM?
Yes please! First step is see if you'd like to contribute to any one of the major implementations:
- Reference OVM implementation
- Rust OVM implementation

### Build a scalable blockchain application?
Soon! And without so much headache!

Developers should not need to learn what a "merkle tree" is in order to write a performant & secure application! Instead we should focus on application logic & make use of standard layer 2 backends.

### Integrate the OVM into your wallet?
The OVM is under active development & at this point should not be integrated into any wallets. However, soon the OVM will provide wallets a common interface for querying & managing layer 2 assets. The OVM acts as a cryptoeconomic light clients for layer 2--enabling layer 2 transaction signing & asset management.
